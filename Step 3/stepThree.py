# Makes a POST request with personal API token to receive a string and
# an array of strings (i.e. needle and a haystack respectively). Reponse
# is saved as a JSON dictionary. Then checks to see if needle
# is in the haystack. Index value is updated accordingly in loop. Token
# and index value are put into JSON dictionary and POST request
# is made to validation url

# Checks to see if the strings in the haystack are equal to the needle.
# If so, it will immediately break from the loop and index will be the
# index at which the needle was found in the haystack.
# Otherwise, index value increases and the next word in the haystack
# is checked to see if it is equal to the needle.
