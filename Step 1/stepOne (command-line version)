//This was what I used as my first attempt to register since I have used cURL
//before, but I decided to try using Python to make an HTTP POST request and
//connect to the API, so that is why I have two step 1 versions.
//This version seems the easiest to me as I was able to connect through a very
//simple command line, but, since I do not have much experience with Python 
//I wanted to gain some more practice using Python and,
//therefore, I redid step 1 using Python instead of cURL

curl -i -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d
